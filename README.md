What is fleet management?

Fleet management creates a system for communication between various types of robotic devices for easier operation and scalability. Robot fleet management encompasses a broad range of activities associated with robot care. 

Fleet management brings to mind parking lots full of rental cars, school buses, or taxis for good reason–a bunch of movable things leave their home base to go out, perform tasks, and return. But that’s about all "fleet management" has in common with its robotic counterpart.

In logistics and transportation, human beings control the action. But with robots, those actions are instead performed by robots. The ability to correctly, accurately, and efficiently perform those interactions and respond to the environment makes fleet management a much more complex endeavor.

***Note: Check the action server and action client. The logic is explained in comments.
      Also, the project seems to be advanced and challenging. Thank you.***
